JustMath.js
===========
An implementation of two dimensional vector math including a rich toolset for vector operations.
It's also the math library behind [eSoccer](http://www.esoccer.me).

JustMath
--------
* Augments core Math
* Allows replacement of core Math methods
* Adds some convenience methods

JustMath.Vec2
-------------
* Vector instantiation and cloning
* Vector addition, subtraction and multiplication (dot product)
* Vector orthogonality
* Vector normalization, scaling, inversion and magnitude calculation
* Vector-Vector distances
* Vector rotation and direction calculation
* Vector projection and rejection
* Vector reflection, also with component-wise scaling (projected and rejected component)
* Vector interpolation
* Vector containment in rectangle
* [Vector,Vector] determinant calculation
* Provides vector operation chaining
* Small allocation footprint when using clone() wisely

Features
--------
* [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/) compatible
* [http://requirejs.org/RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)/AMD compatible
* Shim compatible
* [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS compatible
